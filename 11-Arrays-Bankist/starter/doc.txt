calcDisplaySummary() :
With .filter and .reduce we catch up all deposits and withdrawals of the selected movements array of the selected account, after catching the deposit and withdrawals we display them into the HTML.
We also display the interest tax which effects all deposits, to adquire this tax we use a filter to catch every deposit then we map through the array changing the values to the ones multiplied by the interest of 1.2.
After we have the correct value into the array we use a .filter to bring out every value with is above 1 to finally sum all values using .reduce and then finally displaying into labelSumInterest HTML element.
